usage: AES [-h] [-E] [-D] [-kr size] [-kb hex] [-kt text] [-dr size] [-dt text] [-df path]\
           [-ob] [-ot] [-of path]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

MODE:
  Choose one of the following modes

  -E          Encryption mode\
  -D          Decryption mode

KEY:
  Choose one of the following commands to insert the key

  -kr size    Key from size of a randomly generated byte array (size >= 16)\
  -kb hex     Key from bytes in hexadecimal format\
  -kt text    Key from text

DATA:
  Choose one of the following commands to insert the data to be encrypted / decrypted

  -dr size    Data from size of a randomly generated byte array\
  -dt text    Data from text\
  -df path    Data from file using a path

OUTPUT:
  Choose on of the following commands to output / save the result
